4 Channel Logic Level Converter
================================
Manufactured by : Geek Ammo  
SKU : GMO-00001

Summary
-------
This is a simple bi-directional level converter based on the BSS138 MOSFET following the application note of AN97055 Philips Electronics and AN10441 NXP.

Description
-----------
With a single MOS-FET a bi-directional level shifter circuit can be realised to connect devices with different supply voltages of e.g. 5 Volt and 3.3 Volt to one I2C-bus system. The level shifter can also isolate a bus section of powered-down devices from the I2C-bus, allowing the powered part of the I2C-bus to operate in a normal way.

The level shifter can also be used in other bus systems or point to point connections for level shifting and/or isolation.
